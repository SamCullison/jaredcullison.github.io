* **Introduction**
* To be brief, although time is a vital component in our lives, physicists often dispute if it is truly a fundamental part of reality and the mechanics of the universe. What time is defined as and why such claims arise will be discussed below.

* **How Our Perception of Time has Changed**
* Time is defined as a non-spatial continuum that is measured by a succession of events which form the past through the present to the future. What is important to note is that time is measured by change/a progression of events. However, Einstein proved that time is not constant. Rather, it is part of the subjective fabric of the universe which he called space time.  Space time changes with velocity and gravitational potential energy, and this change manifests itself as space and time dilation. To illustrate an example, if a man is traveling at 60% the speed of light for what he measures as 5 years, upon returning to earth he will find that 6.7 years elapsed while he was gone. Both reference frames(5 years from the man and 6.7 from the people of Earth) are correct, hence making time subjective. As you travel closer and closer to the speed of light, this discrepancy only grows, and because no object can exceed the speed of light, light itself(composed of photons) does not experience time. This begs a question of, what else doesn't experience time as we know it?

* **The Proposed Illusion of Time**
* For Humans, only the present is "real". Obviously we can remember the past through the billions of neurons in our brain and we can speculate and predict the future to a certain degree, but in truth the present is our reality. Another fact of our reality is that time moves in only one direction, that direction being forward. Although time can be stretched or constrained, both the above facts remain true. Now, how can this same perspective be applied to the universe as a whole(and thus be a fundamental of reality) if photons are omitted from times grasp. As it turns out, there is a high likelihood that time is an illusion of our consciousness and thus not a required construct of reality. What this means is that instead of a past, present and future, all 3 states of time occur in the universe simultaneously and thus no direction of time exists. This scenario depicts what physicists call a block universe. A block universe still has 4 dimensions, being the 3 dimensions of space and the one dimension of time, but there is no passing of time. Instead all time references are equally correct, "real" and available.
* Note: The scene of Interstellar in which Murph's room is available to cooper in every moment of time is a visualization of this theory(regarding the availableness of all of time).

* **Final**
* The ideas of the block universe and the illusion of time are both just ideas as of now. Although they both contain certain merit, so do string theory and loop quantum gravity theory, and in the end only one quantum mechanical model can be correct. But despite this uncertainty, quantum mechanics still remains one of the most fascinating fields of science in the contemporary era. And so it is indeed worth it to
