# About the Project 
This synthesis was a part of my Organic Chemistry II course my freshman year. We were to pick a molecule that interested us, and create a synthesis route which was not 
currently used. I chose fentanyl because of its recent publicity with the opoid epidemic, and because of its large use in hospitals. Creating this synthesis was challenging, but I enjoyed the problem solving aspect of having an end goal with limited restrictions and endless reactions to choose from. This synthesis was to be used by graduate students or seniors in their capstone projects (and they would make a fentanyl derivative of course).

# Comparison of Industrial (Siegfried) versus Proposed Synthesis:
Both syntheses share commonalities, such as the use of an acid halide as the final step, as well as the use of aniline to add a phenyl group to the compound via the creation of an imine. However, the two routes also differ in a few keyways. One such variation is the alkylation of the secondary amine (present in 4-peperidone) via reaction with 2 bromo-ethyl benzene. However, due to the increasing nucleophilicity of amines as substitution increases, dialkylation is a possible and likely. This will lead to a mixture of products and thus is not favorable. In the proposed synthesis the tertiary amine is generated from the reduction of an amide, and thus no unexpected products will occur as a result. Another major negative in the Siegfried synthesis is the possible production of the side product phenethyl-4-ANPP. This compound was identified in April 2019 and since then has spread and been found across the United States in fentanyl samples. Current hypotheses believe it is especially prevalent when the Siegfried method reactants are combined in a single step. This product is not synthesized as a byproduct in the proposed method due to the ethyl-phenyl group being introduced in the form of a acid halide. This halide creates an amide at one location (due to its inability to react with an imine) and then is reduced. Therefore, the phenyl-ethyl will be added once during the procedure (as opposed to twice in the formation of phenyl-ethyl-4-ANPP*). Although 4-ANPP is thought to be relatively inactive in-vivo, the research is obviously very new and regardless, any impurity in a fentanyl sample is to be handled carefully.

# Senior Capstone Lab Module: 
Obtain dean stark trap and place 1 eq of 4-piperidinone in a 50 mL round bottom flask with a boiling chip. Place heating mantle under dean stark trap, attach condenser (with water tubes attached) to top of dean stark. Fill dean stark trap half full of NaCl solution. Add 1.1 eq of aniline, 1.1 equivalents of toluene and 3 drops of concentrated H2SO4 to the round bottom and attach it to the Dean Stark. Heat reaction until the condensation of water slows down or the volume of water stops increasing. Remove round bottom flask. Add 1 eq of SOCl2, 1.1 eq of phenyl acetic acid, and 10mL of pyridine (solvent) to a new round bottom flask and reflux for 15 minutes. Cool product to room temperature and add 1 eq of water. Mix for 1 hour. Perform a fractional distillation (BP target 94 C) with this product and collect distilled compound in angled receiving flask. 

In the 50 mL round bottom flask containing the imine product, add the acid chloride (in the angled receiver tube), 1 eq pyridine, and 10mL of di-ethyl ether. Stir for 30 mins. Transfer product to separatory funnel and wash 2 times with 10mL of water. Now the organic layer should contain only the dissolved product. Pour organic layer into 50ml RB flask and treat with .9 eq of LAH. Stir for 35 minutes and then treat with 1.2 eq of water. Put product in separatory funnel and extract aqueous layer. Wash organic layer two more times, each with 5 mL portion of water. Pour remaining organic layer from separatory funnel into 50 mL round bottom flask. Treat with 1 eq of propionyl chloride, 1 eq of pyridine and 10 mL of ethanol. Purify final product via recrystallization. Use vacuum filtration to collect fentanyl crystals.
