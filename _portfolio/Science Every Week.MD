* During my winter break in 2022 I decided to start a blog. This blog would encapsulate my interests, and I would write about topics I've been yearning to learn more about. Not only did I find writing the articles enjoyable, I also found that it improved my retention of the material. Instead of passively watching or reading about the material I was creating my own "review" and I had to formulate my own conclusions. 

* Picking topics to write about also further cemented my curiosity for pharmacology. I loved writing about anesthetics (which led to me shadowing an anesthesiologist) and the COVID vaccines. Learning about these topics added to my education in an extracurricular fashion. 

* While school and my internship halted the production of articles, I look forward to exploring my growing bank of questions this Summer.
