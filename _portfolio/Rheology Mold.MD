# Project Purpose
This mold was created after a researcher in my lab approached me and asked for a device which would enable her to conduct tests on a gel which she was experimenting with. Specifically, PDMS will be poured into the mold and this aforementioned gel will be poured into the wells, crosslinked, and biopsy punched out for testing. Soon after printing the first mold I was asked to produce several more for other members of the lab and their indivisual experiments. Each mold was produced with the Form 3 SLA printer.

# Parametrization
This was the first continuous/parametrized CAD design I had created. Instead of creating dimensions in the sketch as needed I used parameters and equations which I drew up beforehand. I did this because A: I had recently learned about modeling with parametrization and B: I assumed it would benefit the lab if others could easily adjust the design for their own purposes.

# Lessons Learned
The main lesson I learned from creating this mold is the value of planning and parameters. A great deal of time is saved when the model's dimensions are conceived and recorded before the CAD software is used. Additionally, producing a continuous CAD design is a challenge and I enjoyed having to draw up equations that related dimensions to each other and the model as a whole. 
Another lesson I learned was the importance of height when using a SLA printer. The original mold I created was much taller than the end product, and ,as SLA is a height limited production method, I was advised to make . By lowering the device (and making it one piece instead of two) I decreased the printing time by more than an hour.
