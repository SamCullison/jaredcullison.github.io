# Introduction to the Cell Hacker Project

The Cell Hacker Project is the final report for the Synthetic Biology class I took the first semester of my Junior year. Throughout the class a diverse set of cell editing techniques are discussed, and by taking this class I was able to learn about the science which currently drives therapeutic development and the biotechnology industry. The Synthetic Biology final (dubbed the Cell Hacker Project) is a specific problem focused on a theoretical disease which can only be solved with a cumulative solution. The promopt for my project follows: 

"Develop a non-recombinase-based NOT gate to regulate CAR T cell activity. Specifically, you want the T cells to target tumor cells that will kill cells positive for the antigen Axl but not cells that express the antigen Her2.
Design a NOT circuit to achieve this. Choose a method and describe how it would work. Contrast it with alternatives. How would you benchmark engineered cell performance to understand:
The stringency of your logic gate (i.e., the discriminatory power)
The ability of engineered T cells to combat a tumor
The phenotype of cells after exposure to activating stimulus - i.e., are they readily exhausted and do they form a memory compartment
Finally, you want engineered T cells to activate IL-12 expression in response to engagement with Axl antigen. How will you build and test a gene circuit to accomplish this?"

The project was originally presented by my group during our scheduled cell hacker presentation. Individual write ups followed for the final, and mine is attached below. Producing the elaborate mechanisms through which the proposed therapy works proved to be difficult, but overall the report offers a comprehensive view into what a CAR T cell is, how the proposed therapy works, and how the therapy will be benchmarked to validate success in trials and experiments.
